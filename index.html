    <h1>Breakaway for a Vacay</h1>
   
    <body>
        <p>
            During these days everything you do you have to question before.  
            For instance, should I go to the store? Is it safe if I go to my
            favorite restaurant to eat? Can I go on a vacation?  Should I keep
            my trip I had planned?  But for most is can I keep my sanity during 
            this pandemic?
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer to all of these questions is yes you can do these things, but
            if you feel safe to do them.  It's your parrogative. Do your research...If you want to go 
            out to eat,, call the restaurant you want to eat at and see what 
            their new operating practices are.  You can't just sit in the house
            until this virus just goes away.  You have to get out once in awhile and why not
            start with a vacation either out of the country to another state, a day trip to 
            a quaint little town in you state that you have never been too, or if you can't get out       
            Take a virtual trip, let your mind roam free even it be a week, a day, or an hour.  
            Your mind needs a break since 2020 is heating our heads like bricks.

            Wow, I feel that I just had a mini vacation and I didn't even have to go anywhere, just by
            looking at the pictures above.  A little virtual vacation and it didn't cost a thing, lol. 
            So I have found some virtual sites that you can view in the comfort of your own home. 
            By clicking on any of the links below it will take you to another page for your virtual vacation experience. 
        </p>
        <p>So just sit back, relax, and begin to plan your next day out.</p>

            We should be on vacations and enjoying the summer and the holidays.

            The  way to stay sane is get out of the house.  Things have started to
            lighten up with some restrictions, but you can leave the house.  Unless 
            you have medical conditions that prevent you, but you're not left out of
            this either.  What I mean by getting out the house is not going to the 
            grocery store, or to the mall.  I'm talking about taking a trip.  either
            flying, driving, taking a bus or train, to get out of the state you are 
            currently in.  There are still some some travel bans and I will list
            them below, but the upside is there a lot more places you can go to than you
            can not. 
        </p>
        <p> These days are trying times where everything you must question
            Should I go to the store and get what I need? Is it safe to go out to my
            favorit restaurant and eat? Can we go back to church like we used to?
            If someone gets to close to me, what should I do? Do I have to wear a mask when I 
            walk into stores?  Is the person I come in contact with get me sick? Can I travel
            , should I keep my vacation that I had planned? 
            These are all valid questions with a bunch of answers available on the internet
            when you search for them.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Things have gotten easier, but it's still a challenge just to go to your local
            grocery store for some.  Referring back to the last two questions mentioned
            above... Should you keep your vacation that was planned? Can you travel?
            The answer is yes.  As more and more precautions are taken place it has helped to open 
            up the travel industry again.  There are some places that has banned travel, but There
            are tons of other places that you can visit.  

        </p>
        <p>Who would have thought that the normal everyday activities
            that once was is no more.  Times have changed drasticly 
            and quickly.  There was a time that we had to go to school 
            no matter what and now students have choices of either staying 
            home or walking into a school building. There was a time that
            you could just go anywhere with no restrictions, now, you have 
            to wear masks everywhere.
